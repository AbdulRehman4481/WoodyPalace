# Tasks: E-Commerce Admin Panel

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-i-would-like/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), data-model.md, contracts/api-schema.yaml

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Next.js 15 App Router**: `src/app/`, `src/components/`, `src/lib/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Component structure**: `src/components/ui/` for base components, `src/components/features/` for feature-specific
- **API routes**: `src/app/api/` following Next.js 15 conventions
- **Types and utilities**: `src/types/`, `src/lib/`, `src/hooks/`
- Paths shown below assume Next.js 15 structure - adjust based on plan.md structure

- [x] T012 [P] Configure error boundaries and loading states for App Router
- [x] T013 [P] Setup environment configuration with Next.js 15 standards
- [x] T014 [P] Create base UI components (Button, Input, Card, etc.) in `src/components/ui/`
- [x] T015 [P] Setup Zod validation schemas in `src/lib/validations.ts`
- [x] T016 [P] Create utility functions in `src/lib/utils.ts`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Additional Features (Phase 8)**: Can start after core user stories are complete
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 for products
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US3 for orders
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1, US3, US4 for data

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services
- Services before API routes
- API routes before components
- Components before pages
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- All API routes within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- All components within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create Product TypeScript interface in src/types/product.ts"
Task: "Create ProductCategory TypeScript interface in src/types/product-category.ts"

# Launch all API routes for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create product API routes in src/app/api/products/route.ts"
Task: "Create product by ID API route in src/app/api/products/[id]/route.ts"
Task: "Create product image upload API route in src/app/api/products/[id]/images/route.ts"

# Launch all components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Implement ProductList component in src/components/features/products/ProductList.tsx"
Task: "Implement ProductForm component in src/components/features/products/ProductForm.tsx"
Task: "Implement ProductCard component in src/components/features/products/ProductCard.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Products)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Categories)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Orders)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Customers)
   - Developer E: User Story 5 (Analytics)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- All tasks follow Next.js 15 App Router conventions and TypeScript best practices
- Database operations use Prisma ORM with proper error handling
- All API routes include proper authentication and validation
- Components follow modular architecture principles with single responsibility
