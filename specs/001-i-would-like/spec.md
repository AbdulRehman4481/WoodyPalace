## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Product Management (Priority: P1)

As an admin user, I want to manage the product catalog so that I can control what items are available for sale to customers.

**Why this priority**: Product management is the foundation of any e-commerce operation. Without the ability to add, edit, and manage products, the store cannot function.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new product, editing its details, and verifying it appears correctly in the system. This delivers immediate value by enabling product catalog management.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in as an admin, **When** I navigate to the products section, **Then** I can see a list of all products with key details
2. **Given** I am on the products page, **When** I click "Add New Product", **Then** I can fill out product details including name, description, price, and inventory
3. **Given** I have entered product information, **When** I save the product, **Then** the product is created and appears in the product list
4. **Given** I am viewing a product, **When** I edit its details, **Then** the changes are saved and reflected immediately
5. **Given** I want to remove a product, **When** I delete it, **Then** the product is removed from the catalog

### User Story 2 - Category Management (Priority: P1)

As an admin user, I want to organize products into categories so that customers can easily find and browse related items.

**Why this priority**: Categories are essential for product organization and customer navigation. This must be available alongside product management to create a functional catalog structure.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating categories, assigning products to them, and verifying the hierarchical organization works correctly. This delivers value by enabling structured product organization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in as an admin, **When** I navigate to categories, **Then** I can see the category hierarchy
2. **Given** I am on the categories page, **When** I create a new category, **Then** I can set its name, description, and parent category
3. **Given** I have created a category, **When** I assign products to it, **Then** the products are properly categorized
4. **Given** I want to reorganize categories, **When** I move categories or change hierarchy, **Then** the structure updates correctly

### User Story 3 - Order Management (Priority: P2)

As an admin user, I want to view and manage customer orders so that I can process payments, update order status, and handle fulfillment.

**Why this priority**: Order management is critical for business operations but depends on having products and categories in place first. This enables revenue generation and customer service.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing order details, updating order status, and processing order changes. This delivers value by enabling order fulfillment and customer service.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in as an admin, **When** I navigate to orders, **Then** I can see a list of all orders with status and customer information
2. **Given** I am viewing an order, **When** I examine order details, **Then** I can see all items, quantities, prices, and customer information
3. **Given** I need to update an order, **When** I change the order status, **Then** the status updates and is reflected in the system
4. **Given** I need to process a refund, **When** I initiate a refund, **Then** the refund is processed and order status reflects the change

### User Story 4 - Customer Management (Priority: P2)

As an admin user, I want to view and manage customer accounts so that I can provide customer service and understand customer behavior.

**Why this priority**: Customer management enables customer service and business insights. This supports order management and overall business operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing customer profiles, updating customer information, and managing customer accounts. This delivers value by enabling customer service capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in as an admin, **When** I navigate to customers, **Then** I can see a list of all customer accounts
2. **Given** I am viewing a customer profile, **When** I examine customer details, **Then** I can see contact information, order history, and account status
3. **Given** I need to help a customer, **When** I update their information, **Then** the changes are saved and reflected in their account
4. **Given** I need to manage account access, **When** I enable or disable an account, **Then** the customer's access is updated accordingly

### User Story 5 - Analytics and Reporting (Priority: P3)

As an admin user, I want to view business analytics and reports so that I can make informed decisions about inventory, pricing, and business strategy.

**Why this priority**: Analytics provide business insights but are not essential for basic operations. This adds value for business optimization and growth.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing sales reports, inventory reports, and customer analytics. This delivers value by providing business intelligence capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in as an admin, **When** I navigate to analytics, **Then** I can see key business metrics and charts
2. **Given** I want to analyze sales, **When** I view sales reports, **Then** I can see revenue, order volume, and trends over time

4. **Given** I want customer insights, **When** I view customer analytics, **Then** I can see customer behavior, demographics, and lifetime value

### Edge Cases

- When a product is deleted but has existing orders, the product is marked as "discontinued" in those orders to maintain order integrity
- When multiple admins edit the same product simultaneously, the last save wins with no conflict detection
- How does the system handle invalid or malicious input in forms?
- What happens when the system is under high load during peak shopping times?
- How does the system handle partial failures during order processing?
