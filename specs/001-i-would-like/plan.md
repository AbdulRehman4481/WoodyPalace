# Implementation Plan: E-Commerce Admin Panel

**Branch**: `001-i-would-like` | **Date**: 2025-01-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-i-would-like/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a comprehensive e-commerce admin panel using Next.js 15 with App Router, PostgreSQL database, and TypeScript. The system will provide product management, category organization, order processing, customer management, and analytics capabilities. All APIs will be built within the Next.js project using Server Actions and API routes, following modular architecture principles and Next.js 15 best practices.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x with Next.js 15.5.4  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 15, React 19, PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM, Zod validation, Tailwind CSS  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM for type-safe database operations  
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright for E2E testing  
**Target Platform**: Web application (desktop and tablet responsive)  
**Project Type**: Web application with Next.js 15 App Router  
**Performance Goals**: Core Web Vitals compliance (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1), 50 concurrent admin users  
**Constraints**: Single admin role, no bulk operations, last-save-wins for concurrent editing  
**Scale/Scope**: E-commerce admin panel with 5 core modules (products, categories, orders, customers, analytics)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Modular Architecture Compliance**: All components must be self-contained and independently testable with single responsibility principle.

**Next.js 15 Standards**: Must use App Router exclusively, Server Components by default, proper TypeScript interfaces, and follow file-based routing conventions.

**Performance Requirements**: Must meet Core Web Vitals (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1) with proper optimization strategies.

**Code Quality Gates**: TypeScript strict mode, ESLint compliance, proper error handling, and test coverage requirements.
